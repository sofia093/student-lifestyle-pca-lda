## PCA and Discriminant Analysis on Student Lifestyle Data

This group project applies statistical methods to analyze student lifestyle data, focusing on variables such as study hours, extracurricular activities, sleep, social time, physical activity, and GPA.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**  
  - Identifies key factors explaining data variance  
  - Generates correlation matrices, scree plots, and correlation circles  

- **Discriminant Analysis (LDA & Bayes):**  
  - Evaluates how well variables separate student groups  
  - Produces confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and group scatter plots  

### Project structure:
- `PCA.py` and `MainPCA.py` — PCA implementation and visualizations  
- `utilsDA.py` and `mainDA.py` — Discriminant Analysis computations and results  
- `graficePCA.py` and `graficeDA.py` — graph and visualization functions  
- `lifestyle_studenti_data.xlsx` — dataset used for analysis  

> All results are saved automatically in `dataOUT/PCA_results/` and `dataOUT/DA_results/` folders.
